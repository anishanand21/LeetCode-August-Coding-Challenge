Given a function rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function rand10 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

Do NOT use system's Math.random().

Example 1:
  Input: 1
  Output: [7]

Example 2:
  Input: 2
  Output: [8,4]
  
Example 3:
  Input: 3
  Output: [8,1,10]
 

 Note:
  rand7 is predefined.
  Each testcase has one argument: n, the number of times that rand10 is called.
  
class Solution {
public:
    int n, m;
    int rand10() {
        // initialising the values
		n = rand7(), m = 7;
        // making sure n is in the right 1-5 range and, if we can, we settle m too
		while (n > 5) {
            m = n - 5;
            n = rand7();
        }
        // if m was not settled, we do it here
		while (m == 7) m = rand7();
        return (m % 2 ? 5 : 0) + n;
    }
};
